The format string is composed of 0 or more directives (ordinary characters that are not %), which are copied to the output stream. The format string is also composed of conversion specifications, each of which result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

The argument must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order given.
